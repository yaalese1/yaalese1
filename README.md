# Hi ! I'm Yetunde AKA Yaya 

Hi there! I am an experienced Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on JavaScript, React.js, and Ruby on Rails. I have  Healthcare, Customer service and Analytical experience that allows me to design innovative and well-structured projects or debug and improve already designed software architectures. I have designed and collabed on many projects highlighting my skills and knowledge. I am always eager to learn more and improve my skills so that I can provide the best possible solutions to my clients or team.  If you are in need of any help with your Full Stack Development project, I am here to assist you. Let's work together to achieve your goals!

When not coding you can find my in the NYC area indulging in various activites such as softball 🥎 baskeball 🏀 , running 🏃🏾‍♀️ or educating young children at my local parks department 🍁.
